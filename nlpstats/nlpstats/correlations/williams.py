    """Calculates a hypothesis test between two correlations using Williams' test.

    See `Graham & Baldwin (2014) <https://aclanthology.org/D14-1020.pdf>`_
    for details on Williams' test.

    The rows of :code:`X`, :code:`Y`, and :code:`Z` must correspond
    to each other, and the columns of :code:`X` and :code:`Y` must too.
    For input- and global-level correlations, the columns of :code:`X`
    and :code:`Y` must also be paired with those of :code:`Z`.

    If a value from the matrices is missing, it should be replaced with
    :code:`np.nan`. The :code:`np.nan` locations must always be identical for
    :code:`X` and :code:`Y`. The same is true for :code:`Z` for input- and
    global-level correlations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix in which :code:`X[i][j]` contains the
        :code:`X` score for the :code:`i` th system on the :code:`j` th input.
    Y : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix in which :code:`Y[i][j]` contains the
        :code:`Y` score for the :code:`i` th system on the :code:`j` th input.
    Z : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix in which :code:`Z[i][j]` contains the
        :code:`Z` score for the :code:`i` th system on the :code:`j` th input.
    level : str
        The level of correlation, either :code:`"system"`, :code:`"input"`, :code:`"global"`, or :code:`"item"`.
    coefficient : Union[Callable, str]
        The correlation coefficient to use, either :code:`"pearson"`, :code:`"spearman"`,
        :code:`"kendall"`.
    alternative : str
        The alternative hypothesis. :code:`"two-sided"` corresponds to an alternative
        hypothesis that :math:`r(X, Z) \\neq r(Y, Z)`, :code:`"greater"` correponds
        to :math:`r(X, Z) > r(Y, Z)` and :code:`"less"` corresponds to
        :math:`r(X, Z) < r(Y, Z)`.
