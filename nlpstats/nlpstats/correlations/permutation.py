    """Runs a hypothesis test on the difference between correlations.

    This function will compare the correlations of :code:`X` to :code:`Z`
    and :code:`Y` to :code:`Z`. Typically, :code:`X` and :code:`Y`
    correspond to metric score matrices and :code:`Z` is the human score matrix.

    The rows of :code:`X`, :code:`Y`, and :code:`Z` must correspond
    to each other, and the columns of :code:`X` and :code:`Y` must too.
    For input- and global-level correlations, the columns of :code:`X`
    and :code:`Y` must also be paired with those of :code:`Z`.

    If a value from the matrices is missing, it should be replaced with
    :code:`np.nan`. The :code:`np.nan` locations must always be identical for
    :code:`X` and :code:`Y`. The same is true for :code:`Z` for input- and
    global-level correlations.

    The permutation method indicates whether the set of systems (rows) and/or
    inputs (columns) are permuted during the test. They correspond to the
    Perm-Inputs, Perm-Systems, and Perm-Both permutation methods from
    `Deutsch et al. (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00054>`_. Each method
    results in different interpretations for the resulting hypothesis tests.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix in which :code:`X[i][j]` contains the
        :code:`X` score for the :code:`i` th system on the :code:`j` th input.
    Y : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix in which :code:`Y[i][j]` contains the
        :code:`Y` score for the :code:`i` th system on the :code:`j` th input.
    Z : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix in which :code:`Z[i][j]` contains the
        :code:`Z` score for the :code:`i` th system on the :code:`j` th input.
    level : str
        The level of correlation, either :code:`"system"`, :code:`"input"`, :code:`"global"`, or :code:`"item"`.
    coefficient : Union[Callable, str]
        The correlation coefficient to use, either :code:`"pearson"`, :code:`"spearman"`,
        :code:`"kendall"`, or a custom correlation function. The custom function
        must accept two vectors as input and return the correlation between them.
    permutation_method : str
        The permutation method to use, either :code:`"systems"`, :code:`"inputs"`, or :code:`"both"`
        to indicate whether the systems and/or inputs should be permuted during the test.
    alternative : str
        The alternative hypothesis. :code:`"two-sided"` corresponds to an alternative
        hypothesis that :math:`r(X, Z) \\neq r(Y, Z)`, :code:`"greater"` correponds
        to :math:`r(X, Z) > r(Y, Z)` and :code:`"less"` corresponds to
        :math:`r(X, Z) < r(Y, Z)`.
    n_resamples : int
        The number of permutation samples to take

    Returns
    -------
    PermutationResult

    Examples
    --------
    An example of hypothesis testing the input-level Pearson correlation of :code:`X`
    to :code:`Z` and :code:`Y` to :code:`Z` using Perm-Inputs.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> m, n = 10, 25
    >>> X = np.random.rand(m, n)
    >>> Y = np.random.rand(m, n)
    >>> Z = np.random.rand(m, n)
    >>> permutation_test(X, Y, Z, "input", "pearson", "inputs")

    The system-level correlations can be compared even if the columns of :code:`X`
    and :code:`Y` to do not match :code:`Z`:

    >>> X = np.random.rand(m, 2 * n)
    >>> Y = np.random.rand(m, 2 * n)
    >>> permutation_test(X, Y, Z, "system", "pearson", "inputs")
