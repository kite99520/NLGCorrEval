    """Calculates a confidence interval for a correlation via bootstrapping.

    The rows of :code:`X` and :code:`Z` should always correspond to each other.
    That is, :code:`X[i]` and :code:`Z[i]` contain the scores for the outputs from
    system :code:`i`. If the columns of :code:`X` and :code:`Z` correspond to each
    other, :code:`paired_inputs` should be set to :code:`True`, and this is required
    for input- and global-level correlations.

    If a score is missing for a specific output, that value should be equal to
    :code:`np.nan`. For input- and global-level correlations, :code:`X` and
    :code:`Z` must have :code:`np.nan` values in the same locations.

    The resampling method indicates whether the set of systems (rows) and/or
    inputs (columns) are resampled during bootstrapping. They correspond to the
    Boot-Inputs, Boot-Systems, and Boot-Both resampling methods from
    `Deutsch et al. (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00054>`_. Each method
    results in different interpretations for the resulting confidence intervals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix in which :code:`X[i][j]` contains the
        :code:`X` score for the :code:`i` th system on the :code:`j` th input.
    Z : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix in which :code:`Z[i][j]` contains the
        :code:`Z` score for the :code:`i` th system on the :code:`j` th input.
    level : str
        The level of correlation, either :code:`"system"`, :code:`"input"`, :code:`"global"`, or :code:`"item"`.
    coefficient : Union[Callable, str]
        The correlation coefficient to use, either :code:`"pearson"`, :code:`"spearman"`,
        :code:`"kendall"`, or a custom correlation function. The custom function
        must accept two vectors as input and return the correlation between them.
    resampling_method : str
        The resampling method to use, either :code:`"systems"`, :code:`"inputs"`, or :code:`"both"`
        to indicate whether the systems and/or inputs should be resampled during bootstrapping.
        If :code:`paired_inputs=True` and inputs are resampled, they will be sampled in
        parallel for :code:`X` and :code:`Z`, otherwise they will not.
    paired_inputs : bool
        Indicates whether the columns of :code:`X` and :code:`Z` are paired
    confidence_level : float
        The confidence level of the correlation interval, between 0 and 1.
    n_resamples : int
        The number of resamples to take

    Returns
    -------
    BootstrapResult

    Examples
    --------
    Given score matrices :code:`X` and :code:`Z`, the 95% confidence interval for
    the system-level Pearson correlation using the Boot-Both resampling method
    can be calculated as:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> m, n = 10, 25
    >>> X = np.random.rand(m, n)
    >>> Z = np.random.rand(m, n)
