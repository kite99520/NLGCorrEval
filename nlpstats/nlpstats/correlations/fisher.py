    """Calculates a confidence interval for a correlation via the Fisher transformation.

    The Fisher function is a parametric method for calculating the confidence interval
    for a correlation (see `Bonett & Wright (2000) <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02294183.pdf>`_).

    The rows of :code:`X` and :code:`Z` should always correspond to each other.
    That is, :code:`X[i]` and :code:`Z[i]` contain the scores for the outputs from
    system :code:`i`. For input- and global-level correlations, the columns
    should also correspond to each other and thus :code:`X` and :code:`Z` must be
    the same shape; there is no such requirement for system-level correlations.

    If a score is missing for a specific output, that value should be equal to
    :code:`np.nan`. For input- and global-level correlations, :code:`X` and
    :code:`Z` must have :code:`np.nan` values in the same locations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix
    Z : npt.ArrayLike
        A two-dimensional score matrix
    level : str
        The level of correlation, either :code:`"system"`, :code:`"input"`, :code:`"global"`, or :code:`"item"`.
    coefficient : Union[Callable, str]
        The correlation coefficient to use, either :code:`"pearson"`, :code:`"spearman"`,
        :code:`"kendall"`.
    confidence_level : float
        The confidence level of the correlation interval, between 0 and 1.
